# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My initial experience with Python was knowing absolutely nothing. I have never worked with Python in a previous project or class so I looked for things that seemed familiar to Java as I took APCSA last year. Python seems to have a very easy to understand syntax and simple logic. Many methods such as sum() and max() are built in which seems to save time. It also doesn't require you to define the variable type. Python seems to prioritize efficinecy.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I made sure to put in a fair amount of details in my AI prompts. My initial prompt was "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with Java in APCSA. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover: variables and basic data types, conditionals(if/elif/else), loops (for and while), functions, and basic list operations." I made sure to include how I have APCSA experience. Also, when attempting to create a solution I would tend to ask. "I would like a java solution version and a guide on how to go about the question using python. Do not give me the answer." This would allow me to get an idea of what to do using my previous skills learned to go about the python solution.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
I think that working with lists was the most challenging. Learning to do various things with a list seemed difficult initially as java does it much differently. Another thing was definitely understanding that python manages to simplify things that would require lots of code in java. Sum and Max functions are built in and saves so much time than writing it over and over in java.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned that the phrasing and information you give in an AI prompt matters a lot. It can mean the difference of getting an explanation behind the solution you created and just being given the solution. It can show a different level of understanding of code. Rephrasing my prompts has definitely helped in understanding new python content at a faster rate than I thought.
